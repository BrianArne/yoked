*********************
*Types of Distortion*
*********************

- Saturation

- Valve (Tube?)

- Tape

- Clip (symmetric or asymetric)
  Hard clipping
  Symmetrical makes high amplitude odd harmonics
  Asymetrical makes both even and odd

- Vacuum (?same as valve?)

**************
*Oversampling*
**************

?What exactly does over sampling do?
  ? Do we over sample, get some values, and then low pass them at an audible range?
  ? What does oversampling do to the remaining soundwave? 

- 2x


- 4x

*********************************
*Pre and Post Distortion Filters*
*********************************

- What type of filters should go where?
  * ClipDist has a high pass in the front, and two low passes at the end?
  SHould a user be able to control the type of filter on the fronst/
    - Why type of filter? Multiband? Single lp/hp




************
*Questions?*
************

  What do we want to see visually?
  What is a waveshapper?
  Are we looking for a waveshapper?
    How does waveshapper even fit in in this context?
  What type of layout would we expect for a distortion with so many options?

******************
*2nd vs 3rd order*

See Revivter of DSP Fielding

- How is this different from vaccum vs symettrical clip?
- Is there a name for this?
- Where would we expect this in processing?
